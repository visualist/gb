Example Rails 3.2 app
=====================

This is an example Rails 3.2 app (guestbook) which uses a couple of gems I've been wanting to try out. One is kaminari, for pagination. I'm pretty happy with it; it was easy to use.

The other gem is authlogic, for authentication. Authlogic has been around a while and has lived through the changes in Rails; as such, the documentation you find when googling is very time dependent. I stumbled on its setup for a while but pushed onward and glad of it. I have a much better understanding of this gem having gone through this exercise.
