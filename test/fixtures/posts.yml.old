  title: 'Walking post'
  body: 'I just want to say this it is a cold day outside and I am glad to be inside in the warmth. I can always open the window if I decide to change my mind. Or maybe go outside and walk around until I get tired. Then I will run over to the coffee shop and have a hot chocolate and maybe a muffin. Better yet, there is the new place on Lake Street everybody has been talking about.'

  title: I am already
  body:
    I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
    Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
    braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this
    feeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
    which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
    Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
    and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
    frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
    region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is forever

  title: These reflections 
  body:
    These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my
    letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me

    a steady purpose--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
    eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
    have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
    been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
    through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a

  title: These visions
  body:
    These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
    whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also
    became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
    I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
    names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well
    acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
    But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
    thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
